# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

#Project/Goals

My project goals is to determine the strength of the relationship between number of bikes + POI(characteristics)

# Process

Part 1: Connecting to CityBikes API

Tasks:

1.) I had chose New York City as my city of choice and had retrieved all available bike stations in that city
2.) I had used the API to call the latitude, longitude and number of bikes for each bike station. 
    Then I had parsed my JSON response into a Pandas dataframe which I had also converted to CSV

Part 2: Connecting to Foursquare and Yelp APIs

Tasks:

1.) I had connected to the Foursquare API + Yelp API.
2.) For each of the bike stations in Part 1, I had queried both APIs to retrieve information for Restaurants 
3.) Next I had created a DataFrame for the Yelp results and Foursquare results. 
4.) I prefered Yelp API as it allows customization and was easy to use 

Part 3: Joining Data

Tasks:

1.) I had joined the data from Part 1 with the data from Part 2 to create a new dataframe and had also converted to csv 
2.) I had then started cleaning data + EDA visualizations
3.) I had created my own SQLite database and stored the data I had collected 
4.) I had also validated my data. 

Part 4: Building a Model

Tasks:

1.) I had build a regression model that resembles a relationship with the number of bikes and POI(restaurants) characteristics

#Citybikes_boxplot
plt.figure(figsize=(6.4,4.8)) #default size
sns.barplot(data=citybikes, x='Ratings', y='Number of Bikes') #averages with error bars

sns.boxplot(ax=axes[1,1], data=citybikes, y="Bike Stations")
axes[1,1].set_title('[Seaborn] Box-Plot of Bike Stations')

plt.show()

#Citybikes_plotgraph2
fig_2=sns.scatterplot(data=citybikes,
            y ='Latitude',
            x ='Longitude',
            hue='Ratings',
            size='Ratings',
            sizes=(0, 200))
fig_2.set(title='Restaurants in New York City')

#Citybikes_plotgraph
fig_1=sns.scatterplot(data=citybikes,
            y ='Latitude',
            x ='Longitude',

            size='Number of Bikes',
            sizes=(0, 200))
fig_1.set(title='Available bikes in New York City')

#Citybikes_scatterplot graph
sns.jointplot(data=citybikes, 
              x="Ratings", 
              y="Number of Bikes",
              height = 8    # a jointplot is a square by default 
            )
plt.suptitle("JoinPlot Comparing Number of Bikes to Ratings", y=1)

plt.show()

#Citybikes_predictions
sns.lmplot(x='POI_Count', y='Number of Bikes', data=citybikess, line_kws={'color': 'black'});

#Results

(The coverage that I found is that the people in NYC use citibikes quite often and for long periods at a time. The regression model that was built to predict number of bikes, ratings and distance is performing very well.

The low R-squared value appears to reflect that there is a weak correlation
<> Coefficient: Is positive and has a positive affect on Y
<> T-Statistic: Strong coefficient
<> P-Value: Significance of each and is a strong coefficient)

#Challenges

(Some challenges that I faced was learning how to use API's, building a regression model as well as time was a challenge.)

#Future Goals

(If I had more time I would spend more time on going more in-depth with cleaning data and finding more POI and just adding more POI's.)
